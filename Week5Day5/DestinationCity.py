# You are given the array paths, where paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi] means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

# It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

# Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/destination-city/description/

class Solution:
  def destCity(self, paths: list[list[str]]) -> str:
    starts = {a for a, b in paths}  
    for a, b in paths:
      if b not in starts:  
        return b
