# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

class Solution:
  def findPeakElement(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
      if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
        return i
    return len(nums) - 1
